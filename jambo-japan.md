# What is JAMBO International Center Japan?

JAMBO International Center is a grassroots organization that began in Tokyo, Japan in January, 1996. In the beginning, it was hoped that JAMBO would do a combination of projects which would work towards benefiting the natural environment of Africa (especially Eastern and Southern Africa) while promoting the development of the peoples therein. These projects included sales of African handicrafts, publishing of a periodic newsletter, holding a “Current Issues” class, and holding different African countries’ dinners and charity parties. 

Through a process of trial and error, and discovering what impassioned us and what didn’t,  several of these in-house activities were given up while many in-nature activities were taken on.

Two important discoveries in JAMBO’s evolution were:

 - You must do what impassions you in order to have the energy to keep a voluntary organization going.
 - You must find a way to meet the true needs of the people you are working with and working for.

After some 10 years of experimenting with various programs, JAMBO’s programs became fairly consistent, focusing on hiking/outdoor events, charity parties, and environmental restoration events.

There is a fee charged for the hiking events and the charity parties.  Most of the money raised at these events are used to support environmental protection and less advantaged people through our donations to groups working in these areas.  We try to support groups which try to integrate these 2  issues so that society and nature can benefit simultaneously.  

The environmental restoration events are of two kinds.  JAMBO organizes events that deal with ocean or river clean-ups.  Events which deal with tree replanting, path-making, and restoring the environment through getting rid of undesirable plants in order to bring back the forests natural biodiversity are held by various environmental groups in the Kanto Plain, and JAMBO invites its members to take part in these activities.

Anybody is welcome to join in JAMBO activities. In the course of the year, youngsters (as young as 2 years old) to older people (including a few in their 80s) take part in JAMBO events.

JAMBO seeks leaders who are progressive, optimistic, and proactive with a can-do spirit. Working together, JAMBO can become a visionary organization which helps to bring such positive change about.
